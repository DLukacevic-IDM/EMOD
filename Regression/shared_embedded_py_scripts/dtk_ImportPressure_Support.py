"""
The ImportPressure intervention extends the ImportCases outbreak event; rather 
than importing a deterministic number of cases on a scheduled day, ImportPressure 
applies a set of per-day rates of importation of infected individuals, over a 
corresponding set of durations. For example, an ImportPressure intervention set 
with Durations = [10, 10] and Daily_Import_Pressures = [0.1, 5.0] will import 
infected individuals at a Poisson rate of 0.1 per day for 10 days after distribution, 
and will then raise the importation rate to 5.0 per day for the next 10 days, and 
then it will expire and be disposed of. Durations and Daily_Import_Pressures must 
be vectors of equal length. ImportPressure inherits from Outbreak; the Antigen and 
Genome parameters are defined as they are for all Outbreak events.

A note on behavior in single-node vs multi-node simulations -- Daily_Import_Pressures
vector defines a rate of per-day importation for each node that the intervention is 
distributed to. If the example intervention described above, with 
Daily_Import_Pressures = [0.1, 5.0], is distributed to 10 nodes, then the 
total importation rate summed over all nodes will be 1/day and 50/day during the 
two time periods. The user should be aware of this behavior, and divide the vector 
or per-day importation rates by the number of nodes if appropriate.
